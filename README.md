# Serverless-Web-Chat
### Overview:
Create a real-time chat web app using Amazon Web Services - Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, S3, Cognito, CloudFront, and more.

- Build a chat application entirely with AWS services, and no stand-alone servers at all

- Model Restful APIs and create SDKs with API Gateway

- Store and retrieve data with DynamoDB, a NoSQL database

- Serve static resources to browsers using AWS's S3 (Simple Storage Service)

- Manage permissions and access policies using IAM (Identity and Access Management)

- Manipulate and vend data in the cloud using AWS Lambda

- Use CORS to manage client-side security in serverless apps

- Create a user login system with Cognito

- Speed up the web app with a CloudFront CDN
